# Host Prediction in Hypocreales Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
## Contact Info
**Project Lead**: Brooke Allen (bma66@cornell.edu)  
Collaborators: Kathryn Bushley, Kelsey Scott, Catherine Wram

## Project Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to predict host associations of fungi in the order Hypocreales, based on functional genomic traits (e.g., PFAM domains, BGCs, CAZymes). 

**Expected high-level workflow:**
- [assembled genomes + annotations (mycotools database)]  
  → [functional annotations]  
  → [trait matrix + genome/species metadata]  
  → [unsupervised ML clustering & visualization]

## Data Source
- Functional annotation input: derived from the Mycotools database curated by Kelsey Scott.
